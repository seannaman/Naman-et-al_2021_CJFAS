abstract = {We propose a new prior distribution for classical (nonhierarchical) logistic regression models, constructed by first scaling all nonbinary variables to have mean 0 and standard deviation 0.5, and then placing independent Student-t prior distributions on the coefficients. As a default choice, we recommend the Cauchy distribution with center 0 and scale 2.5, which in the simplest setting is a longer-tailed version of the distribution attained by assuming one-half additional success and one-half additional failure in a logistic regression. Cross-validation on a corpus of datasets shows the Cauchy class of prior distributions to outperform existing implementations of Gaussian and Laplace priors. We recommend this prior distribution as a default choice for routine applied use. It has the advantage of always giving answers, even when there is complete separation in logistic regression (a common problem, even when the sample size is large and the number of predictors is small), and also automatically applying more shrinkage to higher-order interactions. This can be useful in routine data analysis as well as in automated procedures such as chained equations for missing-data imputation. We implement a procedure to fit generalized linear models in R with the Student-t prior distribution by incorporating an approximate EM algorithm into the usual iteratively weighted least squares. We illustrate with several applications, including a series of logistic regressions predicting voting preferences, a small bioassay experiment, and an imputation model for a public health data set. {\textcopyright} Institute of Mathematical Statistics.},

abstract = {The management and recovery of populations of bull trout Salvelinus confluentus requires a comprehensive understanding of habitat use across different systems, life stages, and life history forms. To address these needs, we collected microhabitat use and availability data in three fluvial populations of bull trout in eastern Oregon. We evaluated diel differences in microhabitat use, the consistency of microhabitat use across systems and size-classes based on preference, and our ability to predict bull trout microhabitat use. Diel comparisons suggested bull trout continue to use deeper microhabitats with cover but shift into significantly slower habitats during nighttime periods; however, we observed no discrete differences in substrate use patterns across diel periods. Across life stages, we found that both juvenile and adult bull trout used slow-velocity microhabitats with cover, but the use of specific types varied. Both logistic regression and habitat preference analyses suggested that adult bull trout used deeper habitats than juveniles. Habitat preference analyses suggested that bull trout habitat use was consistent across all three systems, as chi-square tests rejected the null hypotheses that microhabitats were used in proportion to those available (P {\textless} 0.0001). Validation analyses indicated that the logistic regression models (juvenile and adult) were effective at predicting bull trout absence across all tests (specificity values = 100{\%}); however, our ability to accurately predict bull trout absence was limited (sensitivity values = 0{\%} across all tests). Our results highlight the limitations of the models used to predict microhabitat use for fish species like bull trout, which occur at naturally low densities. However, our results also demonstrate that bull trout microhabitat use patterns are generally consistent across systems, a pattern that parallels observations at both similar and larger scales and across life history forms. Thus, our results, in combination with previous bull trout habitat studies, provide managers with benchmarks for restoration in highly degraded systems.},

abstract = {Food resource partitioning between similar-sized, sympatric Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis was examined as a possible mechanism enabling their coexistence in a stream (Allaire) of the Sainte-Marguerite River ecosystem, Quebec, Canada. Fish stomach contents and invertebrate drift were collected concurrently during three diel cycles in August to September 1996. The food and feeding habits of an allopatric brook trout population in a nearby stream (Epinette) were studied for comparison. The diel feeding rhythms of the two coexisting fish species were similar. The composition of their diet, however, showed significant differences. Atlantic salmon predominantly (60-90{\%}) fed on aquatic insects, mainly Ephemeroptera (35-60{\%} of the diet). The brook trout mostly (50-80{\%}) fed upon the allochthonous terrestrial insects (mainly adults of Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera) which comprised 5-40{\%} of the stream drift. The allopatric brook trout fed opportunistically on the more abundant aquatic insects and terrestrial insects rarely formed 25{\%} of its diet. The allopatric trout fed nearly twice as much as the sympatric brook trout during a day. The results suggest that the differences in feeding by brook trout in the two streams (with and without Atlantic salmon) are the result of inter-specific interaction with Atlantic salmon and are not related to the differences in food availability between the two streams. Food resource partitioning between Atlantic salmon and brook trout may be viewed as an adaptive response resulting in a greater exploitation of available resources and coexistence. {\textcopyright} 2004 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

abstract = {Shelters are a key component of animal population ecology, as they provide protection from predators and promote visual isolation among competitors. From a behavioral perspective, how shelter availability affects the way individuals allocate their activity in space has been extensively documented. However, how shelters affect the distribution of activity in time (i.e., diel activity) has been less studied in natural conditions. Here, we report results from a field study that used stream enclosures with either high or low shelter availability and stream-dwelling juvenile Arctic charr as a model species. We collected repeated measurements of individual activity 8 times a day (every 3h) for six 24-h periods during a span of 9 days. In shelter-limited enclosures, fish were more active, became diurnal, and were active over a wider span of time each day, compared with fish with access to abundant shelters. In addition, fish were more aggregated and attacked prey over shorter distances and at lower rate when shelters were limited. Body mass did not affect individual activity rates, but smaller individuals extended their activity over longer periods, possibly as a result of interference competition, and were more isolated. Growth rates were similar across treatments and were positively correlated with individual activity rates and the average distance to the nearest competitor. However, additional nonmeasured effects on fitness may occur, such as increased predation risk associated with daytime feeding and extended activity in shelter-limited conditions.},

abstract = {Many animals make contingent decisions, such as when and where to feed, as trade-offs between growth and risk when these vary not only with activity and location but also 1) in cycles such as the daily light cycle and 2) with feedbacks due to competition. Theory can assume an individual decides whether and where to feed, at any point in the light cycle and under any new conditions, by predicting future conditions and maximizing an approximate measure of future fitness. We develop four such theories for stream trout and evaluate them by their ability to reproduce, in an individual-based model, seven patterns observed in real trout. The patterns concern how feeding in four circadian phases—dawn, day, dusk, and night—varies with predation risk, food availability, temperature, trout density, physical habitat, day length, and circadian cycles in food availability. We found that theory must consider the full circadian cycle: decisions at one phase must consider what happens in other phases. Three theories that do so could reproduce almost all the patterns, and their ability to let individuals adapt decisions over time produced higher average fitness than any fixed behavior cycle. Because individuals could adapt by selecting among habitat patches as well as activity, multiple behaviors produced similar fitness. Our most successful theories base selection of habitat and activity at each phase on memory of survival probabilities and growth rates experienced 1) in the three previous phases of the current day or 2) in each phase of several previous days.},

abstract = {Resource competition between animals is influenced by a number of factors including the species, size and relative abundance of competing individuals. Stream-dwelling animals often experience variably available food resources, and some employ territorial behaviors to increase their access to food. We investigated the factors that affect dominance between resident, non-native brook trout and recolonizing juvenile coho salmon in the Elwha River, WA, USA, to see if brook trout are likely to disrupt coho salmon recolonization via interference competition. During dyadic laboratory feeding trials, we hypothesized that fish size, not species, would determine which individuals consumed the most food items, and that species would have no effect. We found that species, not size, played a significant role in dominance; coho salmon won 95{\%} of trials, even when only 52{\%} the length of their brook trout competitors. As the pairs of competing fish spent more time together during a trial sequence, coho salmon began to consume more food, and brook trout began to lose more, suggesting that the results of early trials influenced fish performance later. In group trials, we hypothesized that group composition and species would not influence fish foraging success. In single species groups, coho salmon consumed more than brook trout, but the ranges overlapped. Brook trout consumption remained constant through all treatments, but coho salmon consumed more food in treatments with fewer coho salmon, suggesting that coho salmon experienced more intra- than inter-specific competition and that brook trout do not pose a substantial challenge. Based on our results, we think it is unlikely that competition from brook trout will disrupt Elwha River recolonization by coho salmon.},

abstract = {Modeling individual fish habitat selection in highly variable environments such as hydropeaking rivers is required for guiding efficient management decisions. We analyzed fish microhabitat selection in the heterogeneous hydraulic and thermal conditions (modeled in two-dimensions) of a reach of the large hydropeaking Rh{\^{o}}ne River locally warmed by the cooling system of a nuclear power plant. We used modern fixed acoustic telemetry techniques to survey 18 fish individuals (five barbels, six catfishes, seven chubs) signaling their position every 3 s over a three-month period. Fish habitat selection depended on combinations of current microhabitat hydraulics (e.g. velocity, depth), past microhabitat hydraulics (e.g. dewatering risk or maximum velocities during the past 15 days) and to a lesser extent substrate and temperature. Mixed-effects habitat selection models indicated that individual effects were often stronger than specific effects. In the Rh{\^{o}}ne, fish individuals appear to memorize spatial and temporal environmental changes and to adopt a “least constraining” habitat selection. Avoiding fast-flowing midstream habitats, fish generally live along the banks in areas where the dewatering risk is high. When discharge decreases, however, they select higher velocities but avoid both dewatering areas and very fast-flowing midstream habitats. Although consistent with the available knowledge on static fish habitat selection, our quantitative results demonstrate temporal variations in habitat selection, depending on individual behavior and environmental history. Their generality could be further tested using comparative experiments in different environmental configurations.},

Called "CAP" for "Canonical Analysis of Principal coordinates," this method will allow a constrained ordination to be done on the basis of any distance or dissimilarity measure. We describe CAP in detail, including how it can uncover patterns that are masked in an unconstrained MDS ordination. Canonical tests using permutations are also given, and we show how the method can be used (1) to place a new observation into the canonical space using only interpoint dissimilarities, (2) to classify observations and obtain misclassification or residual errors, and (3) to correlate the original variables with patterns on Canonical plots. Misclassification error or residual error is used to obtain a non-arbitrary decision concerning the appropriate dimensionality of the response data cloud (number of PCO axes) for the ensuing canonical analysis. We suggest that a CAP ordination and an unconstrained ordination, such as MDS, together will provide important information for meaningful multivariate analyses of ecological data by reference to explicit a priori hypotheses.},

To better understand the processes influencing the expression of these phenotypes we examined the influences of growth in length (fork length) and whole body lipid content in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Fish were sampled from the John Day River basin in northeast Oregon where both anadromous ("steelhead") and freshwater resident rainbow trout coexist. Larger males with higher lipid levels had a greater probability of maturing as a resident at age-1+. Among males, 38{\%} were maturing overall, and the odds ratios of the logistic model indicated that the probability of a male maturing early as a resident at age-1+ increased 49{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 23-81{\%}) for every 5 mm increase in length and 33{\%} (95{\%} CI = 10-61{\%}) for every 0. 5{\%} increase in whole body lipid content. There was an inverse association between individual condition and water temperature as growth was greater in warmer streams while whole body lipid content was higher in cooler streams. Our results support predictions from life history theory and further suggest that relationships between individual condition, maturation, and environmental variables (e. g., water temperature) are shaped by complex developmental and evolutionary influences. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Quantification of concealment habitat is likely to be a valuable process in the management of stream salmonids; it is a necessary step in the application of spatially explicit, individual-based models that incorporate concealment behavior. We conducted a series of laboratory experiments with Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss to aid in the identification and quantification of conceal- ment habitat. Overall, individual Rainbow Trout about 12 cm FL readily used low-ceiling spaces with one, two, or four openings for concealment. Structures analogous to weakly undercut banks were used less. Mean use of different cover types was less variable in an experiment in which groups of three fish were tested. Individuals in groups rarely shared cover spaces, even though in another experiment individual fish readily occupied spaces less than 25{\%} of the area of the spaces they rarely shared. One cover structure that was not preferred in a simple choice experiment was used as much as the preferred structure when the former was the only cover available, indicating that habitat preference experiments provide limited information when the issue is whether fish are willing to use specific habitats.},

Microhabitat variables included water depth and velocity, distance from the stream bottom, habitat and refuge use, substrate type, and substrate embeddedness. Age-0 fish were located over fines and gravel substrates in shallow, low-velocity water near stream margins, but were located in shallower water at night. Bull trout were highly associated with loose substrate, and used the substrate interstices for refuge cover. Diurnal bull trout counts decreased and no age-0 fish were observed after 15 September at water temperatures below 6.1 degree C. Nocturnal counts remained relatively constant throughout the study. Our results suggest that age-0 bull trout surveys be conducted at night when summer water temperatures begin to decline.},

abstract = {Studies of interspecific competition for space among stream-dwelling salmonid species have employed a variety of methods, most of which have centered on identifying species differences in microhabitat use. Clear demonstration of competition, however, generally requires evidence that interactions produce a niche shift in one or both species. Laboratory channels or aquaria have frequently been used in controlled experiments concerned with salmonid competition. Field measurements typically involve scuba diving or snorkeling techniques, although carefully managed electrofishing studies have also demonstrated habitat differences between species. Stream dwelling salmonid populations may be limited at different times by competition, predation, or climatic events such as droughts or floods. When populations are limited by processes other than competition, competition is of minimal intensity or nonexistent. Long-term coexistence of sympatric species may be partly facilitated by species differences in habitat use which results from species differences in aggressiveness, innate habitat preference, timing of emergence, morphology, or a combination of these factors.},

abstract = {Competition between brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and brown trout (Salmo truttta) was studied by measuring characteristics of daytime positions held by brook trout before and after removal of the brown trout from 1800 m of a stream. We used four criteria as indices of position quality: "water velocity difference" (the difference between velocity at the focal point and in the fastest current within 60 cm of the fish), water depth, distance to stream bed, and lighting. After brown trout removal, brook trout larger than 15 cm chose resting positions with more favorable water velocity characteristics and more often in shade. The position shift was greatest for the largest brook trout, those of 20–30 cm. Feeding positions of brook trout changed little upon brown trout removal according to our criteria. The shift in resting positions of brook trout after release from competition with brown trout indicates that brown trout excluded brook trout from preferred resting positions, a critical and scarce resource. The combined effects of such interspecific competition, differential susceptibility to angling, differential response to environmental factors, and predation of brown trout on juvenile brook trout may account for declines of brook trout populations while brown trout populations expand in many streams of the northeastern United States where the two species are sympatric.Key words: brook trout, brown trout, competition, ecological release, microhabitat use, resting positions, feeding positions, stream, Michigan},

abstract = {Anthropogenic activities, such as oil and natural gas development (ONGD), have significantly altered the landscape. It is often challenging to identify the mechanistic processes underlying ecological responses to land-use change (LUC). In aquatic ecosystems, alterations to habitat and food availability and water quality associated with increased LUC are key mechanistic pathways that deserve management consideration. We used structural equation modeling to evaluate how LUC associated with ONGD could influence macroinvertebrate and fish across 40 sites in six headwater streams in the Wyoming Range of the Upper Green River Basin, Wyoming. The most important mechanistic pathway varied, but responses were frequently driven by a direct effect of LUC or related to changes in food availability and water quality. Habitat complexity was the least important mechanistic pathway in our models. Our results also highlight that responses may reflect an organism's degree of habitat or resource specialization and/or sensitivity to changes in water quality. Habitat pathways were more important for habitat specialists (e.g., Mottled Sculpin, Cottus bairdii), food pathways were more important for food specialists (e.g., Colorado River Cutthroat Trout, Oncorhynchus clarki pleuriticus; Mountain Sucker, Catostomus platyrhynchus), and sensitivity to increased salinity was important for intolerant species (e.g., O. clarki, C. bairdii, and predatory macroinvertebrates). Continued identification of the specific mechanisms underlying species' responses to increased LUC will aid in the conservation of ecologically and economically important species.},

When the three species were in sympatry, they interacted with each other, forming a size-structured, mixed-species dominance hierarchy in two stream pools. The influences of interference interactions were examined by measuring changes in five characteristics of foraging microhabitat and behavior, focal point height and velocity, cover use, and foraging rate and distance, after the successive removal of two species. Cutthroat trout removal resulted in increased foraging rates and distances, and decreased cover use for brook charr, but no changes for bull charr. After removal of brook charr from the two-species system, bull charr also increased foraging rates and distances and occupied more exposed positions. Moreover, total fish densities, which had initially decreased owing to the removal experiments, were partly compensated for by subsequent bull charr immigration, implying that competitive interactions with brook charr are an important factor in the mechanisms responsible for the regulation of bull charr densities, at least on a local scale.},

To explore the dynamics of growth in migratory bull trout, one of the models, the von Bertalanffy model, was also fitted based on age estimates derived from annuli and growth increments on pelvic fin ray sections for three juvenile outmigration age groups. Among five growth models evaluated, four models fitted to the age-length data described the fish growth for ages 3 to 11 comparably well. Only a model that exhibited positive growth acceleration as age progressed fitted the data less effectively. Growth was significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) related to the age of outmigration from natal streams (1-3 years). Migratory bull trout were found to reach maturation at ages 4-6; the common age-4 maturation was younger than most comparable studies. All mature fish studied reared for 2-3 years in downriver or reservoir habitat. As the adult population size has continued to increase since harvest closure in 1994, further research should be directed towards understanding the trade-offs between these increasing numbers of adult fish and growth, survival, migration, and maturation schedules.},

We examined past efforts through a comprehensive synthesis of peer-reviewed articles evaluating bull trout habitat relationships, and we used field data within classification tree analysis (CTA) to improve our understanding of the consistency of bull trout habitat use patterns. We performed CTA using reach-level habitat data collected from currently occupied stream networks (i.e., those within the current distribution of bull trout) and unoccupied stream networks where hierarchical filters (i.e., area and temperature) were met and from occupied areas where temperature criteria were exceeded. Results from the literature review demonstrated consistent results at the microhabitat and channel unit scales; indicated the importance of slow-velocity, deeper habitats; and, together with observed diel shifts, highlighted the importance of complex habitat regardless of scale or season. At the reach scale, however, our results indicated substantially less consistency in bull trout habitat relationships. Including maximum stream temperature into the CTA did not result in changes to the overall structure of the CTA; results from the CTA indicated that bull trout were found in reaches with larger substrate, deeper pools, and more cover, but the specific criteria differed along a gradient of stream depth. Our results indicated (1) important gaps in our knowledge regarding the role of substrate size in juvenile bull trout habitat use, (2) the need for elucidation of habitat use patterns in downstream reaches, which may act as critical overwintering habitat or migratory corridors, and (3) the need to incorporate sampling efficiencies in future bull trout habitat evaluations.},

@article{Naman2019b,
abstract = {Abstract Dominance hierarchies and the resulting unequal resource partitioning among individuals are key mechanisms of population regulation. The strength of dominance hierarchies can be influenced by size‐dependent tradeoffs between foraging and predator avoidance whereby competitively inferior subdominants can access a larger proportion of limiting resources by accepting higher predation risk. Foraging–predation risk tradeoffs also depend on resource abundance. Yet, few studies have manipulated predation risk and resource abundance simultaneously; consequently, their joint effect on resource partitioning within dominance hierarchies are not well understood. We addressed this gap by measuring behavioural responses of masu salmon Oncorhynchus masou ishikawae to experimental manipulations of predation risk and resource abundance in a natural temperate forest stream. Responses to predation risk depended on body size and social status such that larger fish (often social dominants) exhibited more risk‐averse behaviour (e.g. lower foraging and appearance rates) than smaller subdominants after exposure to a simulated predator. The magnitude of this effect was lower when resources were elevated, indicating that dominant fish accepted a higher predation risk to forage on abundant resources. However, the influence of resource abundance did not extend to the population level, where predation risk altered the distribution of foraging attempts (a proxy for energy intake) from being skewed towards large individuals to being skewed towards small individuals after predator exposure. Our results imply that size‐dependent foraging‐predation risk tradeoffs can weaken the strength of dominance hierarchies by allowing competitively inferior subdominants to access resources that would otherwise be monopolized.

abstract = {Animal species have evolved different diel activity rhythms that are of adaptive value. Theory suggests that diel temporal partitioning may facilitate coexistence between competitors and between predators and prey. However, relatively few studies demonstrate a temporal shift that is predation- or competition-induced. Recorded shifts are usually within the preferred activity phase of animal species (day or night), although there are some inversions to the opposite phase cycle. Temporal partitioning is not perceived as a common mechanism of coexistence. This rarity has been variously ascribed to theoretical considerations and to the rigidity of time-keeping mechanisms, as well as to other physiological and anatomical traits that may constrain activity patterns. Our decade-long study of spiny mice of rocky deserts demonstrates that, while different factors select for activity patterns, endogenous rhythmicity may be an evolutionary constraint.},

abstract = {When food is limited and competition for it is high, individual fish may adopt different diel activity patterns. We followed individual feeding activity in groups of 10 Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) using a combined self-feeding and PIT-tag system. Food was supplied at low and high rewards to five replicate groups of Arctic char and rainbow trout. Four categories were identified in both species: high-triggering diurnal (diurnal fish with the highest self-feeding activity), low-triggering diurnal, nocturnal, and nontriggering fish. On average, the photophase proportion of the total daily activity was ≃90{\%} in diurnal and ≃20{\%} in nocturnal individuals. Rainbow trout offered high rewards did not show any diel preferences. Diurnal Arctic char and rainbow trout with the highest self-feeding activity were initially larger and had the highest growth rates, indicating a high social position. Nocturnal fish were initially smaller and their proportion of trigger actuations much lower than the high-triggering diurnal fish. These still grew successfully whereas nontriggering fish grew significantly less. Thus, some individuals with a low social status may apply an alternative strategy to attain adequate growth by feeding at night when dominant individuals are less aggressive. This may be referred to as concurrent dualism (diurnalism and nocturnalism).},

Consequently, in June 1998, the Bull Trout was listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act as threatened. The Bull Trout has existed in Lake Pend Oreille and its surrounding tributaries since the last ice age, and the lake once supported a world-renowned Bull Trout fishery. To quantify the current status of the Bull Trout population in Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho, we compared the mean age, growth, maturity, and abundance with reports in a study conducted one decade earlier. Abundance was estimated by mark–recapture for Bull Trout caught in trap nets and gill nets set in Lake Pend Oreille during ongoing suppression netting of Lake Trout S. namaycush in 2007–2008. Bull Trout sampled in 2006–2008 were used to estimate age structure, survival, growth, and maturity. Estimated Bull Trout abundance was similar to that estimated one decade earlier in Lake Pend Oreille. Bull Trout residing in Lake Pend Oreille between 2006 and 2008 were between ages 4 and 14 years; their growth was fastest between ages 1 and 2 and slowed thereafter. Male and female Bull Trout matured at a similar age, but females grew faster than males, thereby maturing at a larger size. Our findings suggest that management has effectively addressed current threats to increase the likelihood of long-term persistence of the Bull Trout population in Lake Pend Oreille.},

Surprisingly, two important dimensions of the POLS concept have been neglected: (i) despite increasing evidence for numerous connections between behavioural, physiological and life-history traits, behaviours have rarely been considered in the POLS yet; (ii) the POLS could easily be applied to the study of covariation among traits between individuals within a population. In this paper, we propose that consistent behavioural differences among individuals, or personality, covary with life history and physiological differences at the within-population, interpopulation and interspecific levels. We discuss how the POLS provides a heuristic framework in which personality studies can be integrated to address how variation in personality traits is maintained within populations. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},

Adults of sympatric species often show distinct foraging niche segregation, but juvenile resource use might overlap with adult competitors of similar body size. Resultant negative effects on juveniles can have important consequences for population dynamics, yet such interactions have received little attention in studies of mammalian communities. Using GPS tracking devices, time-depth recorders and stable isotope data, we compared diving depth, activity time, trophic position and foraging habitat characteristics to investigate foraging niche overlap between similar-sized sympatric juvenile Galapagos sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki) and adult Galapagos fur seals (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) and compared each group with much larger-bodied adult Galapagos sea lions. We found little indication for direct competition but a complex pattern of foraging niche segregation: juvenile sea lions and adult fur seals dived to shallow depths at night, but foraged in different habitats with limited spatial overlap. Conversely, juvenile and adult sea lions employed different foraging patterns, but their foraging areas overlapped almost completely. Consistency of foraging habitat characteristics between juvenile and adult sea lions suggests that avoidance of competition may be important in shaping foraging habitat utilization. Resultant specialization on a limited habitat could contribute to low sea lion numbers that contrast with high fur seal abundance. Our data suggest that exploitation by multiple predators within spatially restricted foraging ranges of juveniles might negatively impact juvenile foraging success and ultimately influence population dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2013 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {Abstract Habitat Suitability Curves (HSCs) are the biological component of habitat simulation tools used to evaluate instream flow management trade-offs (e.g., the Physical Habitat Simulation Model). However, traditional HSCs based on empirical observations of habitat use relative to availability have been criticized for generating biased estimates of flow requirements and for being poorly transferable across locations. For fish like salmonids that feed on drifting invertebrates, bioenergetics-based foraging models that relate habitat conditions to net energy gain offer an alternative approach that addresses some of these shortcomings. To make this technique more accessible for practitioners, we present free and user-friendly software for generating bioenergetics-based HSCs. The software also allows sensitivity analyses of HSCs to factors like fish size or prey abundance as well as direct integration of hydraulic data. While some caveats remain, bioenergetic HSCs should offer a more rigorous and credible means for quantifying habitat suitability for instream flow modelling.},

abstract = {We used underwater observation to determine diel habitat partitioning between bull charr, Salvelinus confluentus, and cutthroat trout, Oncorhynchus clarki, during fall and winter (0.1–8.3°C) in two Rocky Mountain streams that differed in habitat availability. The majority ({\textgreater}70{\%}) of both species emerged from concealment cover at night, though bull charr exhibited a greater tendency for nocturnal behavior than cutthroat trout. Differences in day and night counts were most pronounced at temperatures {\textless}3°C, when very few fish of either species were observed in the water column during the day, but both species were common at night. Both species used concealment cover of large woody debris and boulder substrate crevices in deep pools during the day. At night, fish emerged from cover and habitat use shifted to shallow water with low cover. Microhabitat partitioning among species and size classes occurred at night, cutthroat trout moving into shallower, faster water that was farther from cover compared to bull charr. Smaller fish of both species occupied focal positions in slower, shallower water closer to the substrate than larger fish. Large, mixed-species aggregations also were common in beaver ponds both day and night. High variation in diel and site-specific winter habitat use suggests the need for caution in developing habitat suitability criteria for salmonids based solely on daytime observations or on observations from a few sites. Our results support the need to incorporate nocturnal habitat use and partitioning in studies of salmonid ecology.},

abstract = {Resource subsidies often weaken trophic cascades in recipient communities via consumers' functional response to the subsidies. Consumer populations are commonly stage-structured and may respond to the subsidies differently among the stages yet less is known about how this might impact the subsidy effects on the strength of trophic cascades in recipient systems. We show here, using a large-scale field experiment, that the stage structure of a recipient consumer would dampen the effects of terrestrial invertebrate subsidies on the strength of trophic cascade in streams. When a high input rate of the terrestrial invertebrates was available, both large and small fish stages switched their diet to the terrestrial subsidy, which weakened the trophic cascade in streams. However, when the input rate of the terrestrial invertebrates was at a moderate level, the terrestrial subsidy did not weaken the trophic cascade. This discrepancy was likely due to small fish stages being competitively excluded from feeding on the subsidy by larger stages of fish and primarily foraging on benthic invertebrates under the moderate input level. Although previous studies using single fish stages have clearly demonstrated that the terrestrial invertebrate input equivalent to our moderate input rate weakened the trophic cascade in streams, this subsidy effect might be overestimated given small fish stage may not switch their diet to the subsidy under competition with large fish stage. Given the ubiquity of consumer stage structure and interaction among consumer stages, the effects we saw might be widespread in nature, requiring future studies that explicitly involve consumer's stage structure into community ecology.},

abstract = {The cold and clear water conditions present below many large dams create ideal conditions for the development of economically important salmonid fisheries. Many of these tailwater fisheries have experienced declines in the abundance and condition of large trout species, yet the causes of these declines remain uncertain. Here,wedevelop, assess, and apply a drift-foraging bioenergetics model to identify the factors limiting rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) growth in a large tailwater. We explored the relative importance of temperature, prey quantity, and prey size by constructing scenarios where these variables, both singly and in combination, were altered. Predicted growth matched empirical mass-at-age estimates, particularly for younger ages, demonstrating that the model accurately describes how current temperature and prey conditions interact to determine rainbow trout growth. Modeling scenarios that artificially inflated prey size and abundance demonstrate that rainbow trout growth is limited by the scarcity of large prey items and overall prey availability. For example, shifting 10{\%} of the prey biomass to the 13 mm (large) length class, without increasing overall prey biomass, increased lifetime maximum mass of rainbow trout by 88{\%}. Additionally, warmer temper- atures resulted in lower predicted growth at current and lower levels of prey availability; however, growth was similar across all temperatures at higher levels of prey availability. Climate change will likely alter flow and temperature regimes in large rivers with corresponding changes to invertebrate prey resources used by fish. Broader application of drift-foraging bioenergetics models to build a mechanistic understanding of how changes to habitat conditions and prey resources affect growth of salmonids will benefit management of tailwater fisherie},

We further used this information to assess conservation risk of metapopulations using eight population dynamic metrics associated with persistence. Local population abundances were generally low ({\textless}20 redds annually) and the majority of trends were either stable (85{\%}) or declining (13{\%}). Evidence of synchrony among populations was apparent but not related to fluvial distance between streams. Variability in annual abundances was 1.4–2.5 times lower in metapopulations than local populations, indicating moderate portfolio effects across the regional stock complex. Importantly, most metrics of conservation risk were uncorrelated with one another, emphasizing that multiple statistics describing population dynamics at various scales are needed for monitoring and assessing recovery. We provide a composite description of conservation risk based on local and regional population dynamics that can help inform conservation management decisions for bull trout and other freshwater fishes.},

To address these needs, we collected microhabitat use and availability data in three fluvial populations of bull trout in eastern Oregon. We evaluated diel differences in microhabitat use, the consistency of microhabitat use across systems and size-classes based on preference, and our ability to predict bull trout microhabitat use. Diel comparisons suggested bull trout continue to use deeper microhabitats with cover but shift into significantly slower habitats during nighttime periods; however, we observed no discrete differences in substrate use patterns across diel periods. Across life stages, we found that both juvenile and adult bull trout used slow-velocity microhabitats with cover, but the use of specific types varied. Both logistic regression and habitat preference analyses suggested that adult bull trout used deeper habitats than juveniles. Habitat preference analyses suggested that bull trout habitat use was consistent across all three systems, as chi-square tests rejected the null hypotheses that microhabitats were used in proportion to those available (P {\textless} 0.0001). Validation analyses indicated that the logistic regression models (juvenile and adult) were effective at predicting bull trout absence across all tests (specificity values = 100{\%}); however, our ability to accurately predict bull trout absence was limited (sensitivity values = 0{\%} across all tests). Our results highlight the limitations of the models used to predict microhabitat use for fish species like bull trout, which occur at naturally low densities. However, our results also demonstrate that bull trout microhabitat use patterns are generally consistent across systems, a pattern that parallels observations at both similar and larger scales and across life history forms. Thus, our results, in combination with previous bull trout habitat studies, provide managers with benchmarks for restoration in highly degraded systems.},

However, the pay-offs may vary predictably over time, and it can be predicted that (a) more dominant competitors should gain access to resources at the preferred times and (b) the degree of temporal segregation will vary with the intensity of competition. 2. Here we show experimentally that individual brown trout Salmo trutta (L.) made sequential use of foraging areas, with dominant individuals feeding mainly at the most beneficial times of dusk and the early part of the night while more subordinate fish fed at other times. 3. However, the degree of overlap in foraging times between high-ranking fish was dependent on energetic demands. At low temperatures (when requirements were low) the temporal activity patterns of top-ranking fish were synchronized, with foraging concentrated at the preferred times. In contrast, when temperature was raised to increase energetic requirements, activity patterns showed strong temporal segregation: the most dominant fish remained predominantly nocturnal, whereas second-ranking fish became increasingly diurnal. 4. This is the first experimental demonstration of shifts in the daily pattern of activity caused by varying intensity of intraspecific competition.},

abstract = {Juvenile Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, changed their foraging strategy markedly after a brief exposure to a model trout predator, in ways that reduced their conspicuousness and hence risk of being preyed upon. After seeing the predator, the salmon were less likely to orientate to passing food particles, and having orientated, were less likely to attack them. They also reduced the extent of their movements, by only attacking those food particles that came close to them, and by delaying attacks until the food had reached its closest point. They were slower to orientate to approaching food items, possibly because more visual attention was switched to scanning for predators and less to feeding. However, there was no change in the outcome of attacks, indicating that the reduced food intake was not caused by a reduction in appetite. The relative priority given to foraging and predator avoidance varied with time elapsed since the predator was last sighted; as a consequence, intake rates in the 20 min following the predator presentation averaged only 33{\%} of the pre-predator level, but had increased to 57{\%} 20 min later, and had recovered completely within 2 h. ?? 1987.},

abstract = {We propose a new prior distribution for classical (nonhierarchical) logistic regression models, constructed by first scaling all nonbinary variables to have mean 0 and standard deviation 0.5, and then placing independent Student-t prior distributions on the coefficients. As a default choice, we recommend the Cauchy distribution with center 0 and scale 2.5, which in the simplest setting is a longer-tailed version of the distribution attained by assuming one-half additional success and one-half additional failure in a logistic regression. Cross-validation on a corpus of datasets shows the Cauchy class of prior distributions to outperform existing implementations of Gaussian and Laplace priors. We recommend this prior distribution as a default choice for routine applied use. It has the advantage of always giving answers, even when there is complete separation in logistic regression (a common problem, even when the sample size is large and the number of predictors is small), and also automatically applying more shrinkage to higher-order interactions. This can be useful in routine data analysis as well as in automated procedures such as chained equations for missing-data imputation. We implement a procedure to fit generalized linear models in R with the Student-t prior distribution by incorporating an approximate EM algorithm into the usual iteratively weighted least squares. We illustrate with several applications, including a series of logistic regressions predicting voting preferences, a small bioassay experiment, and an imputation model for a public health data set. {\textcopyright} Institute of Mathematical Statistics.},

abstract = {Elements in bull trout biology, population dynamics, habitat, and biotic interactions important to conservation of the species are identified. Bull trout appear to have more specific habitat requirements than other salmonids, but no critical thresholds of acceptable habitat condition were found. Size, temporal variation, and spatial distribution are likely to influence the stability of local and regional populations. Disruption of key habitat charac- teristics threatens the persistence of local populations, and isolated populations are not likely to persist indefinitely. Conservation of bull trout will require maintenance or restora- tion of multiple, high-quality, connected habitats distributed throughout conservation areas, which in turn should be distributed throughout the species' range.},

abstract = {Human activities create threats that have consequences for freshwater ecosystems and, in most watersheds, observed ecological responses are the result of complex interactions among multiple threats and their associated ecological alterations. Here we discuss the value of considering multiple threats in research and management, offer suggestions for filling knowledge gaps, and provide guidance for addressing the urgent management challenges posed by multiple threats in freshwater ecosystems. There is a growing literature assessing responses to multiple alterations, and we build off this background to identify three areas that require greater attention: linking observed alterations to threats, understanding when and where threats overlap, and choosing metrics that best quantify the effects of multiple threats. Advancing science in these areas will help us understand existing ecosystem conditions and predict future risk from multiple threats. Because addressing the complex issues and novel ecosystems that arise from the interaction of multiple threats in freshwater ecosystems represents a significant management challenge, and the risks of management failure include loss of biodiversity, ecological goods, and ecosystem services, we also identify actions that could improve decision-making and management outcomes. These actions include drawing insights from management of individual threats, using threat attributes (e.g., causes and spatio-temporal dynamics) to identify suitable management approaches, testing management strategies that are likely to be successful despite uncertainties about the nature of interactions among threats, avoiding unintended consequences, and maximizing conservation benefits. We also acknowledge the broadly applicable challenges of decision-making within a socio-political and economic framework, and suggest that multidisciplinary teams will be needed to innovate solutions to meet the current and future challenge of interacting threats in freshwater ecosystems.},

abstract = {The diet of Salmo gairdneri and S. trutta in a Pyrenean stream was very similar, and was also similar to the percentage composition of the drift but not the benthos. There was a good correlation between diel changes in the amount of food (both numbers and biomass) in the stomachs and diel changes in the abundance of drifting invertebrates. The major feeding period was in the early hours of the night when the trout fed chiefly on benthic invertebrates in the drift. This was the only feeding period in experiments 1 and 2 (mean water temperatures 4.7 and 7.3° C) but in experiment 3 (10.8° C), there was a second feeding period in the day when terrestrial invertebrates and emerging aquatic insects formed a large proportion of the diet. Neither species was consuming a greater amount of food than the other. The weight of food consumed/trout/day increased with water temperature, and was close to the daily food requirements for resting metabolism in experiment 1. for twice resting metabolism (active metabolism) in experiment 2, and for four times resting metabolism in experiment 3. Therefore the energy of the second meal in experiment 3 was available for growth. The effect of temperature, on rates of gastric evacuation was the chief factor which determined the number of meals/day; the availability of food organisms in the drift determined the time of feeding; and the requirements for metabolism (affected by temperature and body weight) determined the amount of energy left for growth. {\textcopyright} 1973 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Many species living in deeper lentic ecosystems exhibit daily movements that cycle through the water column, generally referred to as diel vertical migration (DVM). In this study, we applied bioenergetics modelling to evaluate growth as a hypothesis to explain DVM by bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) in a thermally stratified reservoir (Ross Lake, WA, USA) during the peak of thermal stratification in July and August. Bioenergetics model parameters were derived from observed vertical distributions of temperature, prey and bull trout. Field sampling confirmed that bull trout prey almost exclusively on recently introduced redside shiner (Richardsonius balteatus). Model predictions revealed that deeper ({\textgreater}25 m) DVMs commonly exhibited by bull trout during peak thermal stratification cannot be explained by maximising growth. Survival, another common explanation for DVM, may have influenced bull trout depth use, but observations suggest there may be additional drivers of DVM. We propose these deeper summertime excursions may be partly explained by an alternative hypothesis: the importance of colder water for gametogenesis. In Ross Lake, reliance of bull trout on warm water prey (redside shiner) for consumption and growth poses a potential trade-off with the need for colder water for gametogenesis.},

abstract = {Studies collecting data on bioenergetic rates in fish typically measure the rates of a large number of individuals once and then fit parameters to those data sets. Such data commonly have large amounts of variation around the mean, which is left unexplained because the study aims to address population-level or ecosystem-level questions. We addressed the question of whether individual fish have detectably different rates of maximum consumption and respiration rates by repeatedly measuring those rates in individually identified young-of-year (age-0) rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss over a range of temperatures. In experiment 1 we measured the respiration rates of two size-classes of age-0 rainbow trout five times at five different temperatures (9-19 degrees C). In experiment 2 we measured the respiration and maximum feed consumption rates of one size-class of rainbow trout five times at four different temperatures (7-19 degrees C). We also use these data to develop a new parameter set for a Wisconsin bioenergetics model of maximum consumption and respiration rates for age-0 rainbow trout. The results show that individual differences have a significant effect on their respiration and maximum feed consumption rates. The new bioenergetics parameter set differs considerably from the parameter sets developed for adult rainbow trout. The new bioenergetics model may prove useful for studies examining the growth and feed consumption of age-0 rainbow trout. The finding of significant differences between individuals in measured rates of respiration and maximum consumption may be important in individual-based models (IBMs) of fish populations. Specifically, IBMs have not included individual-level differences in bioenergetic rates, but such differences may have an important effect on their predictions of fish growth, production, and population number.},

abstract = {Ontogenetic shifts in fish habitat use often occur to reduce the risk of predation or cannibalism. We examined the large- and small-scale spatial behavior of juvenile Bull Trout Salvelinus confluentus during the spawning migration of adfluvial adult Bull Trout into a tributary (Smith-Dorrien Creek, Alberta) where juveniles rear. We evaluated whether juvenile spatial behavior suggested a direct response to adults that may be interpreted as an attempt to reduce predation risk. Our results showed that the juvenile response to the influx of adults was size dependent, with larger juveniles migrating downstream into Lower Kananaskis Lake and smaller juveniles moving into shallower reaches and margins of the creek. From 1992 to 2002, the downstream migration of juveniles occurred after the upstream migration of spawning adults. Juveniles migrating downstream into the lake were predominantly age 3, with some age-2 individuals. The lateral movement of juvenile Bull Trout in the creek in response to the presence of adult Bull Trout spawners was also assessed by comparing water depths occupied before, during, and after the spawning period. Median depths of water used by juveniles decreased when adults were present and then shifted to prespawning water depths once spawners had left the creek to return to the lake. These results suggest that behaviorally driven habitat segregation of juvenile and adult Bull Trout occurs at both a small scale (within the creek) and a large scale (within the watershed), likely to reduce cannibalism and to maximize juvenile survival.

@article{Rosenfeld2020,
abstract = {Juveniles of different salmonid species often co-exist along environmental gradients, making them a useful model for identifying dominant trade-off axes and their stability within a biological hierarchy (e.g. from individuals to populations to species). In this perspective, we use multivariate trade-offs among juvenile coho salmon and rainbow trout as a case study to explore broader-scale patterns of trait association. Multivariate ordination identified a dominant trade-off axis between high growth, consumption, and growth efficiency vs. high aerobic scope and active metabolism among individual juvenile rainbow trout and three ecologically divergent rainbow trout populations. This pattern suggests a dominant trade-off between growth and active metabolism among individuals and populations, facilitated by simple developmental controls on increased energy intake (larger digestive tract, potentially more risky foraging behavior). In contrast, the adaptive trade-off differentiating species appears to have shifted to maximizing growth and consumption (trout) vs. maximizing growth efficiency (coho), based on evolved differences in foraging strategy and digestive physiology. The generality of these patterns remains uncertain, but trade-offs related to growth efficiency may be an under-appreciated dimension of adaptive differentiation in fishes, and their relationship to digestive strategy and active metabolism warrants further investigation.},
